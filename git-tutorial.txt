Just one country with 1,1 plot doesn't work
Some countries don't work, e.g., SOLVED
Israel, ISR
Tanaznia, TZA

Setting future_day_count to a really big number like 200 doesn't make any difference on the plots

To make a checkpoint:
1. Open a terminal
2. type `cd covid-king`
3. type `git status` to see which files are currently uncheckpointed
4. type `git add .` to add all uncheckpointed files
5. type `git commit -m "<message>"` to save the current state of your files

To revert to a previous checkpoint:
1. Open a terminalgi
2. type `cd covid-king`
3. type `git log` to see the commit history
    (type `q` to exit the log)
4a. type `git checkout HEAD~n` where n is the number of commits you want to go back by
4b. or type `git checkout <commit>` where <commit> is the hashtag for the specific commit you want to revert to

To add your own changes to github:
1. Open a terminal
2. type `cd covid-king`
3. commit your changes (using the 'to make a checkpoint' instructions)
4. type `git push`
5. Enter in your username and password when prompted

To sync your own files with github's version:
1. Open a terminal
2. type `cd covid-king`
3. type `git pull`

If you get merge conflicts or other weird things, let me know and I'll show you how to fix it
